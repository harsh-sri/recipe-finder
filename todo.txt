To extend this application, here’s a couple challenges to continue coding RecipeFinder:

Change the switching of favorited items to be saved in the redux store, so that even on reloads of the same recipe, you can’t re-favorite them.

Delete favorite items from your favorite recipes list.

Have a banner message appear every item an item is favorited.

Add localStorage through this library: https://github.com/15Dkatz/sfcookies, to store favorite items so that they are saved on a reload of the application.
